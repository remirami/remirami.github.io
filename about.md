I enjoy building clean, easy-to-use systems, while also recognizing how challenging it is to design them well. Creating something that feels simple to the user often requires careful structure, iteration, and attention to detail - and learning this “art” is something that genuinely motivates me.
I’m especially drawn to systems-heavy domains, which is why I enjoy tabletop RPGs and role-playing games in general. They combine rules, structure, creativity, and edge cases — many of the same challenges found in real-world software systems.
I believe testing is one of the most important aspects of software development. Whether it’s unit tests, integration tests, system-level testing, or even early-stage paper prototypes and user feedback, testing helps ensure that software behaves as intended and remains maintainable over time.
I also see AI as a permanent part of modern software development. While it can be a powerful tool, I believe critical thinking is more important than ever - AI is a good hired hand, not the master.
