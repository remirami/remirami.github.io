I enjoy building clean, easy-to-use systems, even though I know that making them truly work well is often more challenging than it first appears. I’m genuinely motivated to keep learning how to balance simplicity for users with a solid and thoughtful underlying structure.

I’m drawn to systems-heavy domains like tabletop RPGs, where rules, edge cases, and creativity all come together in ways that feel very similar to real-world software. I find that combination both fascinating and fun to work with.

I see testing as a key part of good software development, whether that’s unit and integration tests, early paper prototypes, or simply getting feedback from real users to improve the experience.

I view AI as a useful tool in development, but one that needs to be guided by strong critical thinking. It’s a good hired hand, not the master.
